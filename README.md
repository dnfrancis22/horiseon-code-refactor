**Horiseon-code-refactor**

**Description**

Horiseon is a marketing agency that wants their own website to be more optimized for search engines. They want to achieve this by making their site meet accessibility standards.

To optimize their site, I started by adding a favicon. This does not directly effect SEO but it can create increased usability which does affect SEO.

Next I changed the div tags to semantic elements. This better defines sections allowing browsers to better interpret content.

To make the site more accessible, I added alt attributes to the images. I created an image tag in the index.html for the main image that was originally linked in the style.css file so that I could add an alt attribute to it. This allows people that use screen readers to hear a description of the image on the page. I changed the back ground color of the aside so that it better contrasts with the text.

And finally I went through the style.css file and cleaned up the redundancy to make it more efficient. I also fixed one of the links in 
the vav bar that was not working.
